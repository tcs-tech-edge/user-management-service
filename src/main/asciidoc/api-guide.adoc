use of HTTP verbs.

[[overview-http-status-codes]]
== HTTP status codes

UMS tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP status codes.

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `201 Created`
| A new resource has been created successfully. The resource's URI is available from the response's
`Location` header

Whenever an error response (status code >= 400) is returned, the body will contain a JSON object

[[overview-hypermedia]]
== Hypermedia

UMS uses hypermedia and resources include links to other resources in their
responses. Responses are in https://github.com/mikekelly/hal_specification[Hypertext
Application Language (HAL)] format. Links can be found beneath the `_links` key. Users of
the API should not create URIs themselves, instead they should use the above-described
links to navigate from resource to resource.
